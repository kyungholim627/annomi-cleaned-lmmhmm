high,0,client:,Usually three drinks and glasses of wine.,neutral
high,0,client:,Something like that.,neutral
high,0,client:,Okay.,neutral

high,0,client:,Okay.,neutral
high,0,client:,Hmm. Seven?,neutral
high,0,client:,Wow. I knew my doctor didn't like me drinking the amount that I did but I didn't know that seven was the limit.,neutral

high,0,client:,"Hmm. Well, that's not good news.",neutral
high,0,client:,"Well, to be honest, I drink sometimes when I'm feeling down and I find it more interesting and not so blur.",neutral

high,0,client:,Yes on occasion.,neutral
high,0,client:,Sometimes I just don't like how much I drink. I sometimes finish a bottle in one night.,neutral

high,0,client:,"Mm-hmm. Yes, sometimes I feel worse after drinking.",neutral
high,0,client:,"Well, I don't think that I'm ready to cut down to seven drinks a week. That seems like a lot but I would consider cutting back to two drinks a night. I think that would be my goal.",change
high,0,client:,I'd say an eight.,change
high,0,client:,"Well, I'm more ready than a six because I'm ready to cut back on my drinking and I don't wanna make my depression any worse.",change
high,0,client:,Maybe having less wine in the house.,change

high,1,client:,"Well, I-- If-if I was getting fallen down drunk or if I drink every night. Um, it's not like I get sloppy drunk or anything.",sustain
high,1,client:,So I'm already at the week limit. And then I have four beers a night. Are you sure?,sustain
high,1,client:,I have five or six beers when I go out with friends to a bar. It's not a problem for me.,sustain
high,1,client:,"Well, I don't consider my drinking binge drinking.",sustain
high,1,client:,I don't chug a lot of beers in a row. I have about five or six beers throughout the entire evening.,sustain
high,1,client:,But I'm healthy. What health problems are you talking about?,sustain
high,1,client:,"Well, I didn't know about those things.",neutral
high,1,client:,"Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me.",sustain

high,1,client:,E-exactly.,change
high,1,client:,"Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about.",neutral

high,1,client:,Yeah.,neutral
high,1,client:,Sounds good.,neutral

high,2,client:,"No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it.",neutral
high,2,client:,"I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up.",change
high,2,client:,I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do.,change
high,2,client:,"Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it.",sustain
high,2,client:,"To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner.",neutral
high,2,client:,"No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving?",neutral
high,2,client:,"Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter.",change
high,2,client:,"Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ.",change
high,2,client:,"Um, six or seven.",change
high,2,client:,I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight.,change
high,2,client:,Yes.,change
high,2,client:,"Getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it. My wife does the shopping for us, so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice, that would solve it.",change
high,2,client:,"I suppose I could replace it with, um, a low-calorie drink or drink more water.",change
high,2,client:,"I'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with, um, sugar-free drinks.",change
high,2,client:,A 10.,change
high,2,client:,Great. It sounds good to me.,change
high,2,client:,Okay.,neutral
high,13,client:,"Oh, I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I've been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them.",sustain

high,13,client:,"Uh, okay.",neutral

high,16,client:,"I sit down and talk with him, asked him for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says fully he'll be there for me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine.",change
high,16,client:,He doesn't have kids.,neutral
high,16,client:,"He doesn't-- I don't know if he can really understand what it means to me. Um, he's a good mate.",neutral
high,16,client:,"The food would be good. Um, I get- I get support with-- my whÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnau is really supportive, but I'm- I'm worried about losing- I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm worried about, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm in charge of myself. That would probably be really good.",neutral
high,16,client:,"I don't wanna hang on to freedom if it this- if it means that I lose my kids. Um, I'm just, uh, I'm just worried about-- I'm worried about if I move in with family, that they, even if their intentions are good-",change
high,16,client:,I don't know. I'll do anything to get my kids back.,change
high,20,client:,"Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again.",sustain
high,20,client:,Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.,sustain
high,20,client:,"I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.",change
high,20,client:,"Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now.",sustain
high,20,client:,"Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.",neutral
high,20,client:,"Yeah, exactly.",sustain
high,20,client:,"I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-",neutral
high,20,client:,"-and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that."" so.",neutral
high,20,client:,Yeah.,neutral
high,20,client:,"No, I mean, we're two separate people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know.",change
high,20,client:,Yes.,neutral
high,20,client:,"Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, this year I'm gonna quit smoking"" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. And quitting doesn't happen.",change
high,20,client:,Yeah.,neutral
high,20,client:,"Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation.",sustain
high,20,client:,"I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it.",change

high,35,client:,"Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you.",neutral
high,35,client:,Thanks for having me.,neutral
high,35,client:,"So I am, um, 28. And I moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, But I'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight's at right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff.",change
high,35,client:,"Yeah. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating.",change
high,35,client:,Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.,change
high,35,client:,"Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally it was that time.",change
high,35,client:,"Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?",neutral
high,35,client:,"Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. So that definitely has shifted, um, but I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen.",change
high,35,client:,Mm-hmm.,neutral
high,35,client:,"Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I were to pick up some type of activity.",change
high,35,client:,Mm-hmm.,neutral
high,35,client:,"Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more things done.",change
high,35,client:,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.",change
high,35,client:,"Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better.",change
high,35,client:,"Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, like I've had a lot more of a negative outlook on it.",change
high,35,client:,"Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I'm eating, I don't think are that great. So that also kind of does the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself.",change
high,35,client:,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,change
high,43,client:,"Um, well, you know, I have a lot of anxiety, and so there's this test that I have to take. It's a big test and I've kind of been putting it off just 'cause I get very anxious. I don't trust in myself that I'm going to do good at it. Um, and so that's something that's like always on my mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's like, I gotta just do it. Um, but I always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. And I just want to, I don't want to feel that way.",change
high,43,client:,Yeah.,neutral
high,43,client:,"Exactly. So, I just avoid it and put it off.",neutral
high,43,client:,"Um, maybe like a four or five.",neutral
high,43,client:,"I mean, because I-I have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think I'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. And so that's why I would rate it as like a four or five because I'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me.",change
high,43,client:,Yeah.,neutral
high,43,client:,"Yes. And I already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. So, um, now I'm actually enjoying that because I-I already like changed date and everything. So now it's actually coming.",neutral
high,43,client:,Yes.,neutral
high,43,client:,"Um, well I think it's this kind of long time coming. I just need to do it and then I can figure out, if I don't pass, I have to wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the next three months. And if I do, then I can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all a lot of weight on me and I think about it every single day. And I'm just sick of thinking about it.",change
high,43,client:,"Yeah. But then I do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. So then I worry about if I don't pass it, you know, like people are going to ask me how I did and if I don't pass it I'm gonna have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me. Um, so that makes me really anxious.",neutral
high,43,client:,Right.,neutral
high,43,client:,"Uh, I would say maybe like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I did not want to do it. I was trying to find every way that I can get out of during this recording. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way sometimes I carry myself, like not confident and very anxious, um, I think other people don't always believe in me.",neutral
high,43,client:,"And so, um, when I played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself. So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious too again people compliment me, but it was a nice feeling because I really didn't trust in myself. And to know that I did a good job.",neutral
high,43,client:,"Um, it made me feel good.",neutral
high,43,client:,"Yeah, I did.",neutral
high,43,client:,Yeah.,neutral
high,43,client:,"I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those tests. And so, um, but that if I pass this test, if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did a good job like the-- you know, I mean, I would like to have that feeling again.",change
high,43,client:,You know.,neutral
high,43,client:,Right,neutral
high,43,client:,Yeah.,neutral
high,43,client:,"Well, considering this test is coming on the way in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then I think my confidence might go up a little bit.",change
high,43,client:,"And maybe just having that faith in myself that, you know, that I can do it instead of just thinking that I can't.",change
