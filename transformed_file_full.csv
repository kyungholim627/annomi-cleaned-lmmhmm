high,0,"therapist: Thanks for filling it out. We give this form to everyone once a year regardless of why they come in. It helps us provide better care. Is it okay if I take a look at what you put down?
client: Sure.
therapist: So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average-
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: and you usually have three to four drinks when you do drink.
client: Usually three drinks and glasses of wine.
therapist: Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week.
client: Something like that.
therapist: Okay. Just so you know, my role, um, when we talk about alcohol use, is just to share information about risk and to help patients who want help. This is different than telling them what I think they should do. I don't do that.
client: Okay.
therapist: Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking.
client: Well, I usually drink when I'm at home trying to unwind and I drink while I'm watching a movie. And sometimes, um, I take a bath but I also drink when I take a bath sometimes.
therapist: Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?
client: Okay.
therapist: Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women.
client: Hmm. Seven?
therapist: Seven.
client: Wow. I knew my doctor didn't like me drinking the amount that I did but I didn't know that seven was the limit.
therapist: Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?
client: Yes. What-what kind of health problems?
therapist: Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat.
client: Hmm. Well, that's not good news.
therapist: Well, how do you think your drinking relates to the depression you've experienced?
client: Well, to be honest, I drink sometimes when I'm feeling down and I find it more interesting and not so blur.
therapist: Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?
client: Well, then I feel blur again.
therapist: So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to.
client: Yes on occasion.
therapist: And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink.
client: Sometimes I just don't like how much I drink. I sometimes finish a bottle in one night.
therapist: So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?
client: No, it's not like I get crazy or anything but I just don't like the amount that I'm drinking.
therapist: Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink.
client: Mm-hmm. Yes, sometimes I feel worse after drinking.
therapist: Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?
client: Well, I don't think that I'm ready to cut down to seven drinks a week. That seems like a lot but I would consider cutting back to two drinks a night. I think that would be my goal.
therapist: If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?
client: I'd say an eight.
therapist: Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?
client: Well, I'm more ready than a six because I'm ready to cut back on my drinking and I don't wanna make my depression any worse.
therapist: What would help you cut back to two drinks?
client: Maybe having less wine in the house.
therapist: Having less wine in the house will help?
client: Yes.
therapist: What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?
client: Well, I like to watch movies, read a book, and take a bath but sometimes I drink when I take a bath.
therapist: So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too.
client: Mm-hmm. Yes.
therapist: Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back.
client: Yes.
therapist: Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?
client: Sure.
therapist: Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds.
client: Okay."
high,1,"therapist: And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use?
client: Sure.
therapist: Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week?
client: Yeah, but only on the weekend.
therapist: Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks.
client: Yeah. Uh, maybe a couple more.
therapist: Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?
client: So, uh, are you saying I drink too much?
therapist: How would you define drinking too much?
client: Well, I-- If-if I was getting fallen down drunk or if I drink every night. Um, it's not like I get sloppy drunk or anything.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk.
client: So I'm already at the week limit. And then I have four beers a night. Are you sure?
therapist: So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?
client: I have five or six beers when I go out with friends to a bar. It's not a problem for me.
therapist: You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people.
client: Well, I don't consider my drinking binge drinking.
therapist: Why is that?
client: I don't chug a lot of beers in a row. I have about five or six beers throughout the entire evening.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion.
client: But I'm healthy. What health problems are you talking about?
therapist: Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen.
client: Well, I didn't know about those things.
therapist: Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?
client: Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me.
therapist: And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?
client: Well, that was fine until I came here, uh, but now that I know about the health risk, uh, I have something I gotta think about.
therapist: So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?
client: E-exactly.
therapist: So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?
client: Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about.
therapist: Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?
client: Uh, I don't know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I'd wanna change things then.
therapist: So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you?
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is. So thanks again for taking the time to fill this out and being honest with me, uh, to talk about it. I provide better care, uh, when I know about my patient's substance use. When we come back for a three-month follow-up appointment for your ADHD, I'd also like to talk to you and check in about your alcohol use too, if that's okay with you.
client: Sounds good.
therapist: Okay, great. See you next time."
high,2,"therapist: Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going?
client: Well, doc, I know you told me that I need to lose weight. And even though the scale didn't show today, I was able to lose about 5 pounds, but then I gained it right back.
therapist: Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further?
client: No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it.
therapist: All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds.
client: I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up.
therapist: But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight.
client: I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do.
therapist: Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back.
client: Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it.
therapist: And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have?
client: To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner.
therapist: John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?
client: No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving?
therapist: You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?
client: Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter.
therapist: Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?
client: Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ.
therapist: Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in.
client: Um, six or seven.
therapist: All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?
client: I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight.
therapist: So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?
client: Yes.
therapist: But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?
client: Getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it. My wife does the shopping for us, so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice, that would solve it.
therapist: Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do?
client: I suppose I could replace it with, um, a low-calorie drink or drink more water.
therapist: Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?
client: I'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with, um, sugar-free drinks.
therapist: Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen?
client: A 10.
therapist: I agree. All right. Well, you-you know what? I'm not gonna start any medications today. Your levels were a little bit off, but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint. What do you think?
client: Great. It sounds good to me.
therapist: Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks.
client: Okay."
high,13,"therapist: Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines.
client: Oh, I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I've been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them.
therapist: Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?
client: Uh, yeah, well, I was just- I was reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, like, naturally and stuff in their immune systems.
therapist: Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?
client: Well, yeah. I mean, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now I'm immune. Right? So.
therapist: That's right. Having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if I offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her Lily today?
client: Uh, okay.
therapist: Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous.
client: Wow, I didn't realize it was so dangerous. I've never heard of polio.
therapist: Hmm. Some of these things I've mentioned to you, you're-you're not familiar with. Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with those things.  Um, so having shared this information with you, what do you think about the idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?
client: Uh, I guess it's okay. I mean, I just I want her to be healthy and safe.
therapist: It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before you make any medical decisions for her.
client: Yeah, I just want to do what's right."
high,16,"therapist: So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with Tristan. What are the sort of pros and cons of that? What are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?
client: Oh, it's a nice place. It's close to work. It's good living with a mate.
therapist: Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes.
client: Yeah.
therapist: What's your thinking around that?
client: That's the thing, isn't it? I am-- I don't know if it's the best place for me to be if I'm gonna make those changes.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: And Tristan is a good flatmate.
therapist: Yeah.
client: I have no-- We're going in different-different directions now. He doesn't have the same kind of responsibilities I have and stuff, and so-- And I can't expect him to change his whole life around, just because I wanna change mine.
therapist: Right.
client: I just-- I don't know how keen I am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though.
therapist: Okay. You're good to explore, but I just want to ask you about, how much does Chris-Christian-Christian know-- Tristan know about you changing your life? What does he really know about the changes you wanna make?
client: I sit down and talk with him, asked him for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says fully he'll be there for me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: He doesn't have kids.
therapist: Right.
client: He doesn't-- I don't know if he can really understand what it means to me. Um, he's a good mate.
therapist: Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with whÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?
client: The food would be good. Um, I get- I get support with-- my whÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnau is really supportive, but I'm- I'm worried about losing- I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm worried about, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm in charge of myself. That would probably be really good.
therapist: In terms of that freedom and in charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own family, and to enable you to do that, where do some of that freedom stuff sit with re-engaging back with your whÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnau and your children, your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang on to, or how you're going to manage that?
client: I don't wanna hang on to freedom if it this- if it means that I lose my kids. Um, I'm just, uh, I'm just worried about-- I'm worried about if I move in with family, that they, even if their intentions are good-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: I don't know. I'll do anything to get my kids back."
high,20,"client: Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again.
therapist: You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.
client: Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.
therapist: Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?
client: I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.
therapist: So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?
client: Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now.
therapist: What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?
client: Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.
therapist: Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?
client: Yeah, exactly.
therapist: How were you successful when you quit before?
client: I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that."" so.
therapist: Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?
client: Yeah.
therapist: But they don't feel as scary to you now?
client: No, I mean, we're two separate people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know.
therapist: You're doing the best you can do.
client: Yes.
therapist: Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?
client: Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, this year I'm gonna quit smoking"" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. And quitting doesn't happen.
therapist: It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?
client: Yeah.
therapist: If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?
client: Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation.
therapist: Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?
client: I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it.
therapist: Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?
client: Yeah.
therapist: Where do you think we should go from here?
client: I don't know. I-I'd like some help. I just don't know what kind of help I need.
therapist: Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There's different medications you can try.
client: I don't like medicine.
therapist: Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever.
client: That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that.
therapist: Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.
client: That would be really nice.
therapist: Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.
client: I would like that. That would be great.
therapist: Great.
client: Thank you.
therapist: Sure."
high,26,"therapist: So what's been going on?
client: I just want my call, that's it.
therapist: All right. yeah, I was told that you're phone calls was taken away
client: [scoffs] Yeah.
therapist: What-what happened?
client: I don't know. Some of-- One of the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something. I don't- I don't know what it is. Something about me not making my bed, something about my attitude. I don't know, I just want my call, man.
therapist: Okay. yeah, it was weird when I, uh, got that report because for the most part since you've been here, uh, you'd been like, uh, model-model resident, uh, always making their bed, uh, been pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, of all the other residents. So, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in three weeks? It must be pretty hard.
client: I just wanna contact my mom, that's it.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you used to have contact with your mom, you know, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you haven't even gotten to talk to her. I can imagine that being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?
client: My dad's birthday is tomorrow.
therapist: Okay.
client: And I just wanted my call so I can talk to my mom. That's it.
therapist: Like I said, it's been, um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on the outside are starting to settle in. So is that something might be going on with you?"
high,30,"therapist: Hey, Mary. I wanted to bring up to you, um, that your battery died last night. So, can you tell me what happened?
client: I don't know, and I still don't wanna charge it.
therapist: So, it's something you just aren't willing to do?
client: No. I got a lot of stuff to do, I don't need to charge it.
therapist: So, it's not really a priority for you right now, to be charging it?
client: No.
therapist: Okay. Um, and do you understand then the con-consequences of-of what that would be?
client: I guess so. I don't know. I-I-I honestly don't care what the consequences are.
therapist: Okay. Um, would it be okay if I do share you what will happen if you don't charge your battery.
client: Sure. I'll listen.
therapist: Um, you will be getting violations for that, and then if you get so many violations, I mean, we'd have to write a warrant for your arrest, which is looking more of, um, detention time.
client: Whatever.
therapist: And that's still doesn't seem to bother you.
client: No. I just-- I don't care.
therapist: Okay.
client: It really [unintelligible 00:00:58]-- I don't care.
therapist: Um, so I know that you, you know, you know the consequences of it, and yet you're sharing with me it's just not a priority for you at this time.
client: Nope.
therapist: Okay. You know, that is your choice. I mean, I-I-I can't make those choices for you, it is something that you decide to do. Um, so with that being said then, these will be the consequences. I'll have to read the-the violation for you.
client: Yeah, whatever. I Know you got to do your job, but I don't care.
therapist: Okay. Um, any questions about that? Any questions about kind of the next steps from here?
client: I mean, whatever happens happens. I'll deal with it when it happens.
therapist: So, your confidence that you'll be able to deal with possibly going back to detention?
client: I mean, I'll just deal with it when it comes.
therapist: Okay, and it sounds like you know that it's probably coming then?
client: Yeah, I guess so.
therapist: Okay. Well, you know I will be back later. If any questions would arise, we can always talk about that then. Um, otherwise, again, I will have to write a violation, and, um, if you have any questions or need anything from me, please let me know. Um, otherwise, again, I'll be back later today.
client: Okay.
therapist: All right."
high,35,"therapist: Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn.
client: Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you.
therapist: Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in today.
client: Thanks for having me.
therapist: Yeah. Tell me a little bit about yourself.
client: So I am, um, 28. And I moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, But I'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight's at right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff.
therapist: Yeah, you're feeling a little bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?
client: Yeah. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating.
therapist: Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?
client: Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.
therapist: Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active.
client: Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally it was that time.
therapist: You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going.
client: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?
therapist: So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?
client: Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. So that definitely has shifted, um, but I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen.
therapist: Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. Now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, I wanna do things differently.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: I want to be more physically active than I've been.
client: Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I were to pick up some type of activity.
therapist: Great. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?
client: Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more things done.
therapist: Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less irritated by the small stuff.
client: Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.
therapist: Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster.
client: Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better.
therapist: Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?
client: Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, like I've had a lot more of a negative outlook on it.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past.
client: Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I'm eating, I don't think are that great. So that also kind of does the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself.
therapist: Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself.
client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
therapist: Great."
high,43,"therapist: Well, thank you, Tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about this. So, there is something I'd like to ask you that we can kind of discuss in our conversation is what's one thing about yourself or something in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?
client: Um, well, you know, I have a lot of anxiety, and so there's this test that I have to take. It's a big test and I've kind of been putting it off just 'cause I get very anxious. I don't trust in myself that I'm going to do good at it. Um, and so that's something that's like always on my mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's like, I gotta just do it. Um, but I always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. And I just want to, I don't want to feel that way.
therapist: Yeah. This anxiety is this obstacle for you and it sounds like it, then you're just not feeling confident that you could do it and do it successfully to this exam.
client: Yeah.
therapist: And so, it's easier for you to just not do it.
client: Exactly. So, I just avoid it and put it off.
therapist: Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?
client: Um, maybe like a four or five.
therapist: Okay. So, four or five. How combat, like, not like a two or three.
client: I mean, because I-I have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think I'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. And so that's why I would rate it as like a four or five because I'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me.
therapist: Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam.
client: Yeah.
therapist: And before you've been putting it off.
client: Yes. And I already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. So, um, now I'm actually enjoying that because I-I already like changed date and everything. So now it's actually coming.
therapist: Okay. So, you've made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it.
client: Yes.
therapist: And this time, it seems like it's a little bit different this time. How come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?
client: Um, well I think it's this kind of long time coming. I just need to do it and then I can figure out, if I don't pass, I have to wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the next three months. And if I do, then I can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all a lot of weight on me and I think about it every single day. And I'm just sick of thinking about it.
therapist: So that's really encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.
client: Yeah. But then I do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. So then I worry about if I don't pass it, you know, like people are going to ask me how I did and if I don't pass it I'm gonna have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me. Um, so that makes me really anxious.
therapist: Yeah. You kind of want to avoid that. Yeah. Have those other feelings that could come up and if you don't have.
client: Right.
therapist: I'd love to hear from you. When was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?
client: Uh, I would say maybe like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I did not want to do it. I was trying to find every way that I can get out of during this recording. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way sometimes I carry myself, like not confident and very anxious, um, I think other people don't always believe in me.
client: And so, um, when I played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself. So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious too again people compliment me, but it was a nice feeling because I really didn't trust in myself. And to know that I did a good job.
therapist: Yeah.
client: Um, it made me feel good.
therapist: So, in that experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other people saw you and you really, you liked that feeling.
client: Yeah, I did.
therapist: Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Um, how do you think you could relate that to what you're dealing with now?
client: I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those tests. And so, um, but that if I pass this test, if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did a good job like the-- you know, I mean, I would like to have that feeling again.
therapist: Mm-hmm
client: You know.
therapist: So for you to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again
client: Right
therapist: And you just mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself.
client: Yeah.
therapist: So to end our conversation, how do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or five, what would have to happen to get you to like a seven, to feel more confident?
client: Well, considering this test is coming on the way in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then I think my confidence might go up a little bit.
therapist: Mm-hmm
client: And maybe just having that faith in myself that, you know, that I can do it instead of just thinking that I can't.
therapist: So that positive self-talk could really go a long way for you?
client: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
therapist: So to summarize, it sounds like you are still feeling kind of anxious about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it, um, over the past couple years. Yet, this time around, you seem more confident to just get it done. And you've even mentioned times in the past where you were feeling anxious and you were successful about it and that you felt proud about yourself. And you liked the way it means, you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like y-you're ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay. Well, thank you, Tanya.
client: Thank you.
therapist: Mm-hmm."
high,45,"therapist: Hi, Mary, how was your day?
client: Fine. Where do you want me to sign?
therapist: Well, you can sign right there. Seems like you're not in the mood to talk today.
client: Not really.
therapist: Okay. You know it seems like you had uh, a day at school. I noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well.
client: Yeah, whatever. I just, yeah.
therapist: It seems like that doesn't-isn't really a concern for you at this time?
client: It's just like the same thing every day like, I don't really know why. Like um, so I signed your paper, why are asking me all these questions?
therapist: So you're kind of wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your house.
client: Yup.
therapist: Okay. Would it be okay with you if I kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?
client: I guess so.
therapist: You know that I will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff.
client: So you just wanna know my business?
therapist: It does kinda come off as nosy at times I'm sure.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: I know uh, some client:s have struggled with understanding that I really do care about you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as quickly as possible.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Yet you still can seem kind of annoyed that this is something that we still have to do.
client: Yeah. I mean I guess I'll be here if I have to be but I can't make any promises that I won't leave.
therapist: So you're still kinda concerned that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?
client: No, 'cause this just kinda feels like why do you need to know my business? Why do you care?
therapist: Um, and-and I'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've got a lot of other people involved in your life right now with the courts I'm sure, I know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's this one other person kinda checking in on you as well.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming.
client: It's just like a lot.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: And you feel like there's all these rules.
therapist: Yeah. And there is and I'm sure that it is really struggling at times too.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Um, and I know some client:s have expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didn't realize how much they really valued that until it was gone.
client: Right, I think that's the only thing that I wish I had now.
therapist: Your freedom?
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?
client: I guess like your sign your papers.
therapist: Mm-hmm, yup that's one step, just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's kinda annoying at times, it is something that we're contracted to do.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: What are some other ways you feel like you can get your freedom back?
client: Not do this again so that I don't ever have to be here and be stuck in my house and all of these people coming to visit me and know my business.
therapist: So that's something that will motivate you to not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'cause you do not like when we stop by?
client: Yup.
therapist: That's okay. Well, I know that you are making an effort. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Okay. Um, before I leave today is there anything else you'd like to add or-or need to share with me?
client: Not really.
therapist: Okay, well just so you know, again, I do have to come back so I'll see you later today then.
client: Bye."
high,46,"therapist: So, Jacob, everything looks very normal on your physical exam. Do you have any questions for me?
client: No.
therapist: Okay. I see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?
client: Sure.
therapist: Okay. What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your parents about what we say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. Does that make sense?
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay. So, let's take a look. So I see that you have marked that you sometimes use alcohol, and that you have used alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about your alcohol use?
client: It's not a big deal. Sometimes with my friends, we'll drink a few beers and when we're hanging out or when we're at a party, and sometimes rum and cokes.
therapist: Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?
client: Um, three or four, probably. I don't keep track.
therapist: Okay. And how often?
client: Um, probably about once or twice a month.
therapist: Okay. So, you drink with friends, sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. How long have you been doing that?
client: Probably since last October.
therapist: So, for about six months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?
client: What do I like about it?
therapist: Yeah.
client: Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my friends, like when we're at a party at someone else's house, and we're drinking with other people that we don't know. It tastes good.
therapist: Okay. So, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?
client: Um, I don't like when I get sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -when I start throwing up, that's not- I don't like that.
therapist: Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?
client: No, but that happened to someone I know, though.
therapist: Okay. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?
client: Um, one time I missed first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and I was late getting up.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: Mm, mom got mad at me 'cause I wouldn't get out of bed and she said she knew I had a hangover.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?
client: No, but I got grounded for two weeks after that. [chuckles]
therapist: So more negative things about your drinking, like getting into trouble with your mom and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?
client: Yeah, but I only missed school once.
therapist: Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. Is that correct?
client: Yeah.
therapist: That's great. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. As your doctor, I want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol.
client: Okay.
therapist: That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?
client: Um, probably a five.
therapist: A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a little bit ready to stop drinking?
client: Well, I guess I'm just tired of getting in trouble.
therapist: Okay. What could you do to avoid getting into trouble?
client: Um, not drink.
therapist: [chuckles] Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?
client: No, not really.
therapist: Okay. What some people your age do is try stopping drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like.
client: I could probably do that.
therapist: So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?
client: I don't know.
therapist: Do you think you could go two months without drinking?
client: Yeah, probably.
therapist: Okay. What things would make it easier for you to not drink?
client: Um, I could probably drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke.
therapist: Anything else to make things easier for you?
client: I can probably hang out with some of my friends who don't drink or inviting them to parties and having fun 'cause not everyone drinks at parties.
therapist: Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?
client: Yeah. The-- My friends who don't drink would probably be happy that I'm not drinking either and yes, they'd support me.
therapist: Great. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I have you make an appointment for two months from now and then I'll see you back and we can see how things are going?
client: Okay."
high,47,"therapist: Hey, Mary, how are you?
client: Fine.
therapist: Um, I noticed some yelling going on in the house, what's going on?
client: It's not really any of your business.
therapist: So nothing you want to talk about right now?
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: My guess is you're probably involved in that.
client: Hmm.
therapist: Okay, I understand that sometimes if you're feeling angry or upset about something, the last thing you want to do is share with your caseworker at that time, but, um, you know I am here for you, and if there's anything you ever want to talk about or share with me, that is something that I would love to-to here, and I'll just see sit here and listen if that's something that you would find helpful.
client: Okay.
therapist: Okay. You know what? I-it seems like things have been really a struggle for you lately, and I have noticed that you haven't been in the best mood, so I'm really- I am concerned about you, but again, it's your choice if that's something that you feel like you want to share with me.
client: Okay.
therapist: All right, well, you know I will be by later today. If, um, you have any questions or if you want to talk, um, otherwise, again, I'll stop by and call you later.
client: Okay.
therapist: All right, take care, bye."
high,52,"therapist: Hi, Nick. Thank you for completing the CRAFFT questionnaire. I also appreciate you sharing some information about yourself.
client: You're welcome.
therapist: sI see from the questionnaire, did you have got in trouble while using alcohol? Can you tell me more about that?
client: Well, a friend and I would snuck out one night to go to the park, and we got a couple of beers from his house, but the cop came by, and so we threw them in the bushes. He was originally gonna give us a curfew ticket but ended up not to. Luckily, he didn't see the beer.
therapist: That must be really scary.
client: Yeah, it was. If my mom would have found out, she would've killed me.
therapist: I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink?
client: Well, I've only tried drinking once or twice.
therapist: I'm gonna make sure I understand. You have tried drinking a couple of times, and you almost got in trouble once. Did I get that right?
client: Yeah, that's right.
therapist: As your provider, I'm a little concerned about your health. Drinking alcohol could harm you, and I would like to share some information with you. Is that okay?
client: Well, I'm not sure if this information is for me, since I've only been drinking once or twice.
therapist: I understand. You're just experimenting with alcohol. Then, how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are?
client: Well, all I really know is that it's not good for you.
therapist: Are you surprised what that might be true?
client: Yeah, and a couple of my friends drink too.
therapist: Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information?
client: I really didn't think about how this would affect me playing sports.
therapist: Based on your reason for your visit today, I feel like you really wanted to play soccer, and you have great goals about that.
client: Yeah, I would like to play soccer in college.
therapist: That's a great goal to have for yourself.
client: Yeah, I would also like to get scholarships.
therapist: Scholarship will really help you achieving your goals.
client: Yeah.
therapist: I would like to share with you these materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age. I also wanted to encourage you to think about these risks. What do you think about that?
client: Well, I will take a look at it, and I'll definitely read it, and I don't wanna become addicted, and I would like to continue to play sports as long as possible.
therapist: It sounds like you're in the right track, looks like you care about your health, and you care about your goals in life. I'm here to answer any questions.
client: Thanks for all the information.
therapist: You're welcome."
high,63,"therapist: So Tom, this infection is been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm sure that your infection will be gone. Can you do that?
client: Definitely.
therapist: And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?
client: Okay.
therapist: Let's take a look. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?
client: I do some meth.
therapist: Snort it, smoke it?
client: Snort it, always snort it.
therapist: Don't inject it?
client: Mm-mm.
therapist: Use any other drugs?
client: Just, you know, some alcohol.
therapist: And, uh, um, you do this how often?
client: Meth?
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: Um, two, three times a month.
therapist: So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?
client: Right.
therapist: Only snort it?
client: Right.
therapist: Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?
client: Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high.
therapist: So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?
client: Definitely, yeah.
therapist: And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?
client: Yeah.
therapist: Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?
client: No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea.
therapist: Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation.
client: I-I understand but it's I think that would be a hard thing for me to do. You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away.
therapist: So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves Methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using?
client: Yeah, I don't think it would be easy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try.
therapist: Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: -with zero being not ready at all-
client: Mm.
therapist: -and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?
client: Uh, three.
therapist: Why not a one or a two?
client: I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two.
therapist: Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?
client: Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes.
therapist: Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?
client: Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life.
therapist: How could you get a different social life?
client: It's the hard thing, I mean, almost everybody I know uses it.
therapist: Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?
client: My sister.
therapist: Does she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?
client: I haven't really talked to her about it. I think she knows it I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help.
therapist: So on the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine.
client: Yes.
therapist: And there's some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your sister and getting some support.
client: Yes.
therapist: Well, great. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you.
client: Okay.
therapist: I could see you again in a month. Would that work out for you?
client: Yeah, sure."
high,67,"therapist: Is it okay if we go over the form you had filled out? We give this out to everybody who comes in.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: All right. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year.
client: Something like that.
therapist: Okay. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thing I always say, I don't like to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?
client: Uh, I vape. I have a pen, but I don't smoke it though.
therapist: Okay. How often?
client: Um, a few times a month.
therapist: Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?
client: I did a peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me.
therapist: Okay. Is it okay if I share some information with you?
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that I've shared?
client: Well, I don't think it's going to hurt me.
therapist: How do you think it affects you?
client: Um, I don't know. It makes me relax, and it's fun to laugh with my friend.
therapist: Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like?
client: Well, I don't want to get in trouble like at school.
therapist: How could you get in trouble at school?
client: Well, I can get suspended and I would get kicked off the team, the basketball team.
therapist: So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?
client: Right.
therapist: So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use?
client: well, I was thinking to not use when basketball season start.
therapist: What would be the benefits of that?
client: Well, I play better when I'm not high.
therapist: Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?
client: Well, I wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team.
therapist: Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use?
client: For about a month.
therapist: Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick?
client: Um, seven.
therapist: A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like five?
client: Well, I'm pretty sure, um, I can stop using for a month. I want to play well.
therapist: So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?
client: Uh, I don't know.
therapist: How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?
client: Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy, that's when I usually wanna vape.
therapist: What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?
client: Hmm, I like to play video games.
therapist: Anything else?
client: I can play basketball with my friend Sarah.
therapist: Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I would be curious to hear how your plan works out.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Well, Good luck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday, and it's always good to see you."
high,70,"therapist: Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty here today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?
client: Yeah, I do, just a couple of minutes though.
therapist: All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?
client: Um, nothing specific. I just am unfamiliar with the medication.
therapist: Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks.
client: Okay. Uh, what about side effects?
therapist: If there are some side effects to this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?
client: Um, what about does it interact with phenelzine?
therapist: Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this afternoon with that answer?
client: Oh, sure.
therapist: Fantastic. Thank you.
client: Thank you."
high,77,"therapist: Hi, Mrs. Smith. It's really nice to see you again. I see you're back to follow up on the stroke you had. How are things going for you at the rehab facility?
client: [signs] Kind of slow.
therapist: Kind of slow?
client: Yeah.
therapist: What kind of things have you been in your rehab?
client: Oh, they have me doing all kinds of things in different machines and stuff. Yeah, it hurts.
therapist: It hurts? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you having pain?
client: Well, just about every joint like especially my knees. They're really-- They have me doing some leg things that-that-that is it really necessary?
therapist: Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal.
client: Okay.
therapist: But what are your goals for the long term?
client: I wanna go home.
therapist: Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home?
client: Everything. I wanna- I wanna, play with my dog. I miss my dog. I wanna cook for myself. I'm a very independent person and I wanna do things for myself.
therapist: Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there?
client: Um, I guess the rehab.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's also going to be very important that once you're home, you're able to continue on a regular activity program. Have you thought about what that might look like?
client: Not really.
therapist: Not really, okay. Well, have you ever heard of something called Tai Chi? Is that a familiar term to you?
client: Oh, yeah.
therapist: You've heard of it?
client: Uh, I have.
therapist: Okay.
client: I have a friend who, uh, does it and she just raves about it. She loves it.
therapist: Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke. And it's also really good for preventing falls. And if you wanna be home and you wanna be doing the things you wanna do and going for walks with your dog, it's very important to make sure that you don't fall 'cause that would cause more problems down the road.
client: Absolutely. I do not want to fall, for sure.
therapist: So what do you think about Tai Chi? Is that something you think you might be able to try sometime?
client: Well, I-I hadn't really thought about it, but yeah I guess, I guess.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: Like I said, my friend talks about it and-and it's very pretty. I've seen pictures, you know.
therapist: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that easy to get started. You do certainly have to have some motivation to want to do it. Um, and when you first start, oftentimes you do feel a little wobbly or a little insecure.
client: Well, I don't see how I could do it. I-I'm still in a walker, you know.
therapist: Yeah, yeah, I understand. So there are lots of places around that have it. Your local senior center would have it. And what I recommend is that you start by doing it in a chair. Just sitting in the chair.
client: I could?
therapist: You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own.
client: And you really recommend this?
therapist: You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain. But it does have a number of things that I think would get you to your goals of being home and able to play with your dog and doing your own cooking and things like that.
client: You do Tai Chi?
therapist: I do Tai Chi. I do it three days a week and it's really helped my balance as well.
client: Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Um, listen, anything that's going to get me home and if you do it and you recommend it, I'll try it.
therapist: All right. Well, I'm delighted. It's a pleasure to see you again. I hope your rehab continues to go well and we can talk some more about this at our next visit.
client: Okay, okay.
therapist: All right. Thank you for coming in."
high,81,"therapist: Tell me about how you've been feeling?
client: Okay. I guess I've been getting bigger.
therapist: Mm, what's that like for you?
client: Uh, scary I guess.
therapist: So you're feeling uncomfortable with changes in your body?
client: Yeah. I-I know there's something in there, I just don't know much about him.
therapist: Mm.
client: I know you want me to see the doctor, I haven't called yet.
therapist: Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?
client: I don't know. It seems overwhelming to me.
therapist: What about it seems overwhelming?
client: Well, I hate making phone calls and I know I need to fill out all this paperwork. I don't know how to get there and I hate needles.
therapist: Mm. So some of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is you just don't like medical appointments and medical people?
client: Yes.
therapist: How can I help you with these things?
client: Can you help me make the call?
therapist: Sure, we can do that together.
client: Can you go with me to the appointment.
therapist: I can try. I can't guarantee because it depends on my schedule, but we can brainstorm about ideas on who can go with you to support you so you feel better about attending."
high,86,"client: I just feel helpless about this whole deal.
therapist: You're hopeless about what's going on.
client: Mm. I just feel helpless about this whole deal.
therapist: You seem at a loss of where to go from here.
client: No one wants to help me.
therapist: You feel like people aren't willing to help.
client: No one wants to help me.
therapist: You feel alone.
client: Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.
therapist: You realize it's something you shouldn't have done.
client: Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.
therapist: You're feeling regretful.
client: Mm-hmm. I couldn't help myself.
therapist: Uh, it's something that just happened.
client: I couldn't help myself.
therapist: You're nervous that you've lost control of your behaviors.
client: It's actually been a fabulous week.
therapist: You've really had a good week.
client: It's actually been a fabulous week.
therapist: You seem excited about that.
client: Mm-hmm. I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.
therapist: You definitely know how to make good decisions.
client: I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.
therapist: You know that, um, positive peer influences have been helpful for you.
client: Mm-hmm. I'm letting the whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.
therapist: You feel like you're letting your family down.
client: Mm-hmm. I'm letting my whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.
therapist: You feel like you've been a disappointment for them.
client: Mm-hmm. This is not what I want for my life.
therapist: This is not what you've envisioned.
client: This is not what I want for my life.
therapist: You're willing to take steps to improve on that.
client: Mm-hmm. I really want to get off the program.
therapist: You don't want to be here.
client: I really want to get off the program.
therapist: You seem motivated to follow the rules.
client: Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.
therapist: It's something that's always on your mind.
client: I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.
therapist: It takes a lot of, um, strength to still not smoke, even though you're still craving.
client: Mm-hmm."
high,95,"therapist: Right. Hi, Ruth, thank you for coming today. How are you?
client: Um, okay. Just, I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore. I'm-I'm just so stupid. I'm such an idiot. I didn't know what the point of-of this is. I just- I just keep doing the same thing over and over, even though I know it can kill me. I just, I don't have any more willpower, ma'am. Yeah, [foreign language].
therapist: Well, Ruth, it sounds like you're very frustrated first of all. And you're saying that you're just tired. You've lost all your willpower.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: You don't want to continue.
client: No, it just seems that cutting myself is the only way out. And I just get suicidal thoughts and [foreign language], I'm just very, very like depressed and what's going on at home.
therapist: So you feel really, really like you've had it up to here.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Yeah. You're-you're tired. You're stressed. You feel so sad to the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel something other than what you're feeling right now.
client: Yes. Sometimes a pain in-in the body. It's, uh, to [unintelligible 00:01:27] handle and-and the pain inside of me.
therapist: So you were in a lot of pain?
client: Yes. I am.
therapist: I'm sorry about that. It must be very, very frustrating to feel all that pain and not be able to do anything about it. And it seems like the only thing that you can do right now is to cry.
client: Yeah, yeah, suicide.
therapist: It's okay, Ruth. I understand. Pain inside.
client: [foreign language]
therapist: So your mom doesn't understand you and you don't have a dad, that's around?
client: Yeah, 'cause she's a single mom and she struggles a lot. I wanna help her, but I can't help her. So it just makes me sad. I feel like if I don't live anymore, she'll be okay. And she wouldn't have to worry about me or pay my stuff.
therapist: So you feel like your hands are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. She's a single parent. She works a lot. You have all of these problems in your life. And it sounds to me like you feel like you're just adding more problems to her.
client: Yeah.
therapist: And if you're not alive, that's gonna solve the issue for her. She'll do better.
client: I-I think so?
therapist: How is she gonna be better off without you?
client: Because it won't be a burden to her.
therapist: And how are you a burden now?
client: Because she has to pay for my food and my uniforms, um, to have a roof over our heads.
therapist: And how do you help her now?
client: Um, I try to be a good kid. I tried to go to school. I may not have the best grades, but I'm not failing any classes.
therapist: Okay. So then even by you coming here today, Ruth, and talking to me and opening up and telling me that you don't feel like you want to continue moving in and telling me and-and confiding in me that, you know, you hurt yourself and all this pain that you feel, that is you trying to help yourself out in one way or another. And that shows that you care. And even more, it shows that you care about your mom and that, in the end, it doesn't sound like you wanna leave her alone because you're still worried about ot-you're still worried about all the burdens on her that you're even thinking of removing yourselves to make her life easier. That shows me that you care about her so, so much, but right now the immediate solution that you have in your mind, it seems like it's-it's-
client: That's the right one.
therapist: -How could it be the right one? Ending your life hurting yourself when it's just you and your mom. And you just said, she's a single parent. She doesn't have a husband, you don't have a dad. It's just the two of you. So how could it be the right choice? But I understand your pain and I know where you're coming from. And I know that the release that you feel physically is something that helps you in the moment. Are there other things that we can help you find to start replacing, um, that behavior?
client: Um, I don't know. I don't know. It's just, um, I'm not sure I can.
therapist: You're not sure. So you have a lot of on your mind right now. You just opened up to me. You told me that you've been cutting, that you've also been thinking about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but also on the same hand, we see how much you've been trying and how much you've been trying to help out by trying to go to school. We know your attendance is good. You go most of the time, you know, you're trying to keep up your grades.You have a C average, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade you had all semester. So all of those things shows how much effort you've put in and we see that effort. So you've been doing what you can and it's normal to feel like sometimes it's not enough. But that's-that's what we're here for so that you can tell us those things and we can help you.
client: Thank you, ma'am, I feel better.
therapist: Oh, thank you, Ruth. Thank you for coming today.
client: Okay."
high,99,"therapist: Steve, before we're done with our visit today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking.
client: Okay, like what?
therapist: Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Does that sound realistic?
client: Yeah, uh, on the weekends?
therapist: Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?
client: No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep.
therapist: Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.
client: Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have abo-about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.
client: Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad.
therapist: That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?
client: I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five.
therapist: Well, that's great. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?
client: Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I need to be able to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic. So, that's-that's why the middle-ground, five.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category.
client: Yes.
therapist: Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?
client: Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking.
therapist: Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?
client: Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers.
therapist: Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?
client: Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week.
therapist: Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a look at this and try to make some improvements.
client: Thanks.
therapist: So I'm hoping that in your appointment next month, we can touch base on this and see how it's going.
client: Sure.
therapist: Okay. Good."
high,104,"therapist: Before you go, do you mind if I take a look at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?
client: Okay.
therapist: Thanks. I want you to know that whenever patients and I talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn from what they want to do, if anything. Does that make sense?
client: Yeah.
therapist: Great. So, you wrote here that you've used alcohol in the last year on at least eight days?
client: Yeah. Somewhere around eight days. I'm not sure.
therapist: Okay. How would you describe your drinking?
client: Um, I really only drink at parties. I don't drink at home or anything.
therapist: Okay. What kind of alcohol do you drink at parties?
client: Um, liquor, whenever people are mixing, um, vodka, sometimes beer, but I don't like beer very much. Um, the drinks at parties are usually like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics.
therapist: How much do you think you usually drink at a party?
client: You mean the whole time I'm there?
therapist: Yes.
client: Um, probably four or five drinks.
therapist: Speaker 1: Okay. You checked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?
client: Yeah. It makes me feel relaxed.
therapist: And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.
client: Yeah.
therapist: What kind of things do you forget?
client: Um, I forget how many drinks I've had like when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I'm at.
therapist: Sometimes you forget where you're at.
client: Right.
therapist: Here's the part where I share information. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?
client: Um, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a condom.
therapist: Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?
client: Yeah. We've had sex before and we've used a condom before.
therapist: How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?
client: Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way.
therapist: Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?
client: Yeah. I would've definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.
therapist: There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder.
client: Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone.
therapist: I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?
client: Um, well, it's fun. I like drinking when my friends are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun.
therapist: Okay. And what about your drinking do you not like?
client: Um, I don't like forgetting where I'm at sometimes.
therapist: Anything else?
client: I really don't want any STDs.
therapist: Right. So, on one hand, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don't like putting yourself at risk for STDs?
client: Yeah.
therapist: So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?
client: Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again.
therapist: How ready are you to not drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?
client: Um, a nine.
therapist: Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?
client: Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not.
therapist: Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?
client: Um, well, I wanna count my drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking once I start feeling drunk.
therapist: Great. Who could help you reach this goal?
client: Well, I have this friend who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two drinks at a party.
therapist: Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again.
client: I'm going to talk with him and I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk.
therapist: All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?
client: Okay.
therapist: Great. Thanks for talking with me and I look forward to seeing you again soon."
high,107,"therapist: Well, let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself.
client: Um, pretty obvious [chuckles].
therapist: So, what happened. So first of all, tell me what you did, exactly.
client: What do you mean what I did?
therapist: Well, I mean, where did you cut yourself? I know you said you cut yourself when you-
client: That's the same as always. Same as always.
therapist: Like your arm?
client: Yeah.
therapist: What did you cut yourself with?
client: A razor?
therapist: How deep?
client: Do you wanna see it?
therapist: Yeah. Let me see. You know those look to me like they-they-- did you go to the-- It doesn't look like you went and got any stitches, but that looks to me like you could have used them. What do you think?
client: I think have you ever been to an ER when you cut yourself, you'd know why I don't go.
therapist: Okay, but part of the problem is those look deep and like you're going to have significant scars. So my suggestion is in the future, if you do it, is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed. But let's talk about how, um, how this happened. First of all, tell me, you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die. But, um, did you-- Was this a suicide attempt or do you think it was just-just a cutting? Were thinking of killing yourself or wanting to kill yourself or wanting to die when you did it?
client: I was thinking about killing myself. You thought you would help me and you didn't. That's what I want to talk about. I wanna talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me, and you are not available to me when I need help.
therapist: Okay. So let's-- Okay, so it sounds like me not being avai-- Was me not being available with you, rela-related to you cutting yourself?
client: I cut myself the first time I called you thinking you would help me, you wouldn't help me so then I figured, what the hell I [chuckles] might as well just go all the way. And so, that's why I cut myself that deep."
high,108,"therapist: Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
client: Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately.
therapist: Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?
client: Yeah.
therapist: So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?
client: Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now.
therapist: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
client: Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not.
therapist: Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic.
client: Yeah, exactly.
therapist: Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?
client: Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out.
therapist: Okay.
client: Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night.
therapist: Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. Um, people like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?
client: I-- you know, I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting.
therapist: Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?
client: Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts.
therapist: Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that?
client: Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work.
therapist: Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?
client: Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son.
therapist: Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?
client: [chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born.
therapist: Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?
client: It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights.
therapist: Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?
client: Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit.
therapist: Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?
client: I mean, I think so, yeah.
therapist: All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?
client: Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable.
therapist: Okay. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?
client: Just a couple months from now. He's almost three.
therapist: Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?
client: I've heard of it, but I don't know that much.
therapist: Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?
client: Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure.
therapist: Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?
client: [chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much.
therapist: Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?
client: Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke.
therapist: Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?
client: Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good.
therapist: Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan.
client: Okay.
therapist: All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really nice to have met you.
client: Thanks. All right.
therapist: You're very welcome."
high,113,"therapist: Hi, Sandra.
client: Hi.
therapist: Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by.
client: Well, I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil.
therapist: So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about?
client: I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a good thing.
therapist: So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.
client: I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for her.
therapist: Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.
client: Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now.
therapist: So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?
client: It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out.
therapist: What else? Tell me what else is good about it.
client: Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight.
therapist: Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?
client: Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much.
therapist: So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.
client: Okay.
therapist: So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.
client: That's true. Yeah.
therapist: You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.
client: Yeah.
therapist: I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?
client: Exactly.
therapist: So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?
client: Well, I-I'm worried about my children. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking.
therapist: Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?
client: Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke.
therapist: So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?
client: I felt terrible, you know, I was projecting-- I wanna be a good parent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan.
therapist: And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: -um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two things fit together?
client: It doesn't fit, you know. It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love to do it, but I don't think it's right.
therapist: So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?
client: I can't think of anything right now.
therapist: Okay.
client: I don't have any plans to quit. It's just something I'm thinking about.
therapist: So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for me?""
client: Exactly.
therapist: Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?
client: Oh, sure. Sure, I'll come in. Yeah.
therapist: Okay. So I hear-- [crosstalk]
client: We can talk about it some more.
therapist: [chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?
client: Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.
therapist: Okay, here you go.
client: Thank you.
therapist: So thanks for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week.
client: All right."
high,114,"therapist: In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox. Plus the report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what is the accuracy of the report? And can you share with me some details leading up to the incident?
client: Uh, I guess that sound- that sounds right. I mean, I was- I was kinda drunk and it happened like a week ago. I just, I drove over to my friend's house, um, just to go watch the game and, you know, we're having a couple beers and next thing I know the Vikings are kind of losing pretty big. So we drank a little bit more than usual. And I mean, at the end I had to get home and I couldn't find a ride. So I-I just drove.
therapist: You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. Did I get that right?
client: Yeah. That's-that's exactly how it happened. I mean, I'm a normal college kid. I like to drink and hanging out with my buddies. I mean, I, it wasn't a big house party or anything and I got busted.
therapist: Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends. You didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home.
client: Yeah. I tried to be safe. I mean, I tried to call her roommate, but I don't know, getting in trouble anyways.
therapist: Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think the problem really is?
client: Um, well, I wanna say I have a drinking problem. I think I'd probably have more of a, like getting caught problem. I mean, my friends, they-they drink like fishes and I-- they don't ever get caught and you got me over here and I get caught and they left.
therapist: Sounds like you attribute your current situation to bad luck. If that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, what consequences might result?
client: I guess- I guess more problems with police and school and I really don't have like the time or the money for any of that.
therapist: How important is it that you avoid future problems with the police or school, Dylan?
client: God. It's, I guess, super important, because just-just going to detox alone was-was awful, the experience-- I don't want to do that again. And my dad said if I get suspended from school, um, I have to go- I have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social life. I won't see any of my friends and I mean, it's already bad enough, like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI.
therapist: Yeah. What would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?
client: Well, I guess I- I guess the easy one is I wouldn't- I wouldn't drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more-more likely to get in trouble. So probably I don't wanna drink so much.
therapist: On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with 10 being very confident?
client: Um, I guess I would say like, I don't know, like over halfway. So maybe like a six.
therapist: What steps could you take to move that six to a seven or eight?
client: I could probably, um, I don't know. I-I guess, well, the big thing would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so thenI'm not risking myself to drive or like if I- if I go out to a party waiting till, like, I'm 21 to drink. Um, maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking, like, I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more to do than just drink.
therapist: In what ways might your life be better if you succeed in making the changes you mentioned?
client: Um, I mean, I guess the big one would be like I won't- I won't be hungover all the time like I would make it to my 8:00 AMs then, well, even-even when I make it to my 8:00 AMs now like I just, I sleep like I wake up I'm like, ""Oh my god what's going on?"" And then I get to my 8:00 AM and I'll just sleep through and then miss just about everything that's on the test. So I think if I- if I reprioritize what is important to me, I probably help me succeed. I mean, in high school, I had a 3.5 GPA. So I know I could do it here.
therapist: College is all about making choices. Can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision-making and how do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking?
client: Um, I mean education is really important to me and-and also my family. My parents are always talking about it and I really- I really wanna be an international journalist, to be on the news like, I mean, I have the face for it, um. So I guess if I reprioritize my- if I reprioritize what I need to do I and I won't drink so much. I probably wouldn't be disappointing my parents and I'd be able to get a really good education.
therapist: Thanks for coming in for participating today. Your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150.
client: All right, all right. When is the seminar?"
high,120,"client: Oh, thanks so much doctor. I'll just take it easy for a couple of days.
therapist: Well, since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left, I'd like to bring up another topic. I noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. We haven't really had time to talk about this much before and I may be able to offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?
client: Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up gaining it back. I don't know what to do.
therapist: I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges.
client: Okay, thank you doctor, but I'm just concerned about how I can possibly lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so much of my time.
therapist: Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready.
client: Okay, that sounds great. So, what should I do?
therapist: Well, let's see. One of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life.
client: I knew you were gonna say that, but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day.
therapist: Well, I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing.
client: I like to walk.
therapist: Me too. Walking is great exercise.
client: Wait a minute, isn't walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?
therapist: Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym.
client: Oh, wow, that sounds good. You know what? Come to think of it, I have some time before I have to go back to work and I saw a nice park on the way over here, maybe I can take a short walk after this appointment.
therapist: That sounds great.
client: And you know what? I used to really love to dance, but I haven't done that in such a long time.
therapist: Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun.
client: Hmm. And I know my family would support me if I could just find some place where I can go dancing.
therapist: Oh, that's great to hear that your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym.
client: Yeah, and you know what? I really like to try that.
therapist: Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?
client: Actually, I really would. I'm kind of excited about it. What else you got?
therapist: Well, small steps can go a long way. So, even things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door when you go to a store can be ways to increase movement in your day.
client: Mm-hmm. I can do that.
therapist: How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some other strategies that might help.
client: Diet, the D word.
therapist: Not necessarily. What we eat is certainly important for weight and health, but just like we did today, we can talk about some small steps that can fit into your life, and especially ones that you feel good about.
client: Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and I'll start dancing right away, doc.
therapist: That's great. I'll see you soon"
high,125,"client: The baby was up all night and I'm exhausted.
therapist: So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?
client: Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.
therapist: So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?
client: Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.
therapist: Hmm. So, based on what your mom told you, you were expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?
client: Well, what is normal for a baby this age?"
high,129,"client: Dr. Morrow, I'm so relieved I'm not pregnant.
therapist: Huh, you feel like you dodged the bullet.
client: I really feel like I dodged the bullet. That was- that was probably the scariest like two days of my life.
therapist: It feels like it was like two days was a year?
client: Yup.
therapist: Ah.
client: Yeah, it went so slow.
therapist: Okay.
client: Even just being here today is like minutes ticking by.
therapist: Okay.
client: It's really good news.
therapist: So what would have happened if you found out that you were pregnant?
client: I don't even know. I'm-I'm not ready to have a kid. I know that. I know my life is not ready for that step.
therapist: Okay. That's a big step and that's not the direction you want to go in right now.
client: Yeah, no.
therapist: Would you be open to kind of exploring the idea of birth control and family planning?
client: Um, I don't really want to go there. I just-- that sort of stuff just weirds me out. Yeah, I take something fun and just makes it really medical.
therapist: Now, it's a discussion you don't really wanna have.
client: No.
therapist: At the same time, you have some concerns about the possibility of getting pregnant.
client: Yeah, I mean I'm-I'm careful. I do what I can, but I don't wanna take anything for that.
therapist: So you found some ways to prevent pregnancy up until-- well, maybe, um, you've been pretty fortunate, and then there is also some times where you feel like, ""Oh, no. What if I didn't dodge the bullet?""
client: Yeah. It's-it's scary. I mean, this is the first time I've ever had that sort of feeling of ""What am I gonna do?""
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: And-and that fear was like-- yeah. Up until now, I've been good, yeah.
therapist: Okay. So, you've been able to kind of avoid any kind of consequences, and right now, you're not feeling that talking about birth control is something on your-your list.
client: Yeah. No, it- it's just- it's just weird for me. I don't- I don't like thinking about that stuff, yeah.
therapist: Sure. I totally appreciate that, and it's your decision, Olivia. You know yourself best and what fits for you. If you ever feel like you like to open up the idea of conversation about family planning or birth control, I'd love to talk to you about that another time.
client: Yeah, maybe another time. Just, I'm not ready for it.
therapist: Okay.
client: I'm not ready for that conversation right now.
therapist: Okay. I respect that. Thanks though for coming in to see me today.
client: Yeah.
therapist: And I'm glad that this appointment was a positive one for you.
client: Thank you.
therapist: You're welcome."
low,9,"therapist: So now that we've discussed a little bit of your medical history and- and taking your vitals, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The-
client: Sure.
therapist: -the rise in your blood pressure is concerning to me, so I'd like to gather a bit more information about your lifestyle.
client: Okay.
therapist: Okay. Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?
client: Not really, I haven't been stressed. Uh, I've been working steady, you know, these days, I'm glad to have a job, I really am happy that I'm working, so.
therapist: Yeah, that's certainly true. I'd also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure.
client: Okay.
therapist: Okay, do you smoke at all?
client: I don't smoke. I smoked, you know, as a young adult, quit 20 years ago. I went cold turkey. I was proud of that, haven't even thought about smoking.
therapist: Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine?
client: Uh, I do drink beer, I drink, you know, two to three pints on weekdays, sometimes on weekends, maybe four or five.
therapist: Okay. Well, I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about 15 to 20 drinks per week, and that's definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure.
client: Well, I-- you know, my pressure has been high for years and, um, you know.
therapist: Well, according to your chart, your blood pressure has gone up since July, and you said that you've been drinking more recently, so do you see the connection there?
client: Maybe a little bit.
therapist: Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well.
client: Okay.
therapist: Okay. And how about the use of other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana?
client: I don't use heroin or cocaine. I've never even thought about using the hard drugs. Back in school, 20 years or so ago, I smoked reefer, you know. Once I got out of school, I haven't used that at all.
therapist: Okay. Have you ever used any prescription medications that weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed?
client: No, I don't- I don't, uh, really like the idea of taking pills. Uh, as a matter of fact, a couple of years ago, I had this jaw surgery. They gave me a prescription for Percocet. I took one, maybe feel weird. I think they're still sitting in the medicine cabinet.
therapist: Okay, excellent. Well, it sounds to me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health.
client: Well, I guess I'll try.
therapist: Okay. And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now. We'll recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this, sound okay?"
low,10,"therapist: Hi. You are [unintelligible 00:00:02]?
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay. Um, what brings you in?
client: Well, I'm supposed to come to learn about my-- how to manage my diabetes. Just got diagnosed.
therapist: Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high.
client: Yeah, that's what doctor said. She-she really laid into me about that. Said it was-- I guess, this is really serious stuff. She was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so, [sighs] you know, how-how-how to manage all this, I guess, is what I gotta learn, but it just sounds massive.
therapist: Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious.
client: That's, uh, that's a huge amount of stuff to do and, I'm not- I'm not certain I can do all that, and on top of it, it's-it's-- if I don't get it all done, all this stuff happens to me?
therapist: So, it sure can.
client: [sighs]
therapist: So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high.
client: Well, I-I [unintelligible 00:01:35]"
low,32,"therapist: In summary, the Minnesota State, Mankato security report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence, and then you were transported to detox. Plus, you're only 21 years old. Is the report accurate?
client: I-I guess, uh, I don't really remember much. I like it was a week ago, so I was kind of drunk too.
therapist: Okay. Behavior like this could get you suspended, doesn't that concern you?
client: Hmm. I mean, not really. I'm gonna be 21 in a couple of months. Um, once I turn 21, the cops can't give me a minor and I mean, I'm not a heavy drinker, like-like my friends or anything. I don't get wasted at all. And, uh, I just need to be careful. I just won't get caught. I'm just trying to find, like, a normal college student.
therapist: What were you thinking when you got into your car after having six beers, you could have caused an accident and killed somebody.
client: Whatever, I-I didn't though. I called my roommates for a ride. He was sleepy. So I had to get home somehow. And this isn't even my fault. I give him rides all the time, but I didn't do anything.
therapist: You need to take responsibility for your actions. If you keep partying like this, your problems will only get worse. You're likely to face costly legal citations, poor grades, health problems. Getting kicked out of school and disappointing your parents. You don't want that to happen, do you?
client: No-no. Like I said, this isn't even my fault. Like, are we done here? I have class in 15 minutes.
therapist: Your behavior is not what Minnesota State University expects of its students. If you wanna be a student here, you'll need to show that you're able to follow our rules. Do you think you can do that, otherwise, you'll be suspended?
client: Look, I really like going on the [unintelligible 00:02:29] and I get what you're saying. You, you're making some really good points and I'll think about them. Okay?
therapist: Okay. Well, your sanction is you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation and you'll have to attend an alcohol education seminar that'll cost you $150. Also, disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative, meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer.
client: $150, are you serious? I can't pay that. All right, I'm done with this. I'm over it."
low,69,"therapist: Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?
client: I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist? I just had a question about citalopram.
therapist: Yeah, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects.
client: Okay, but I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine?
therapist: Oh, um, yeah, I think that should be fine.
client: Okay, thanks for that. I have an appointment to run to.
therapist: All right, thanks. Call me anytime."
low,74,"therapist: Hi, Emily. How are you?
client: I'm doing all right. How are you?
therapist: I'm good. Um, wow, what's changed? What do we have here?
client: Oh, I got my lip pierced.
therapist: Emily, why? Why did you get your lip pierced?
client: Why? I don't know. I wanted a change and-
therapist: You're-
client: Well, I mean, nobody needs a piercing, I wanted one. It was a-
therapist: Do you know what-
client: Oh, I mean, it's my lip that's pierced, not my teeth.
therapist: Well, yes, except that, you know what's gonna happen. See how-- Do you feel how when you're moving your lips-- Smile for me. Okay. So, do you see how when your muscles are moving, that piercing is rubbing against your gums-
client: Yeah.
therapist: -as well as your teeth. So, we can see some recession that's gonna start to happen-
client: Yeah.
therapist: -possibly, um, affecting the tooth itself, chipping the tooth, et cetera. So, it's something that we definitely don't like to see.
client: I mean, it's been okay so far. It hasn't caused me any problems.
therapist: Well, it's only been a month.
client: Yeah.
therapist: I think it [unintelligible 00:01:18] days yet, and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing.
client: I mean, I just put in-
therapist: Just-
client: -I'm not gonna take it right out. It's-- Like you said, I've only had it in for a month, I mean.
therapist: Emily, I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just-- I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you, you know, just mature, et cetera, and I hate-- I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this. I really would.
client: Well, I mean, if it starts to cause a problem, then maybe we talk about it, but at this point, I mean-
therapist: All right.
client: -it's fine.
therapist: All right. Okay.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay.
client: Yeah.
therapist: Okay. We'll continue with the exam, but you know where I stand on this. Okay?
client: Yeah."
low,92,"therapist: Hi, are you Julie Thompson?
client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
therapist: Hi, I'm Bruce Berger, I work in the clinic. I know you're here to pick up a prescription today.
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: Um, I noticed, uh, we noticed some of your records that, uh, you've been coming in and getting Sarah's resc-rescue inhaler for her asthma quite frequently, and you haven't got a chronic inhaler for quite some time now. I also know she has been in the emergency room several times this year. Is-- can you tell me what's going on there?
client: Well, I did a research on the chronic inhaler, and I saw that there were steroids in it, and I do not want my daughter taking steroids. I read about all the side effects of steroids and all the potential health problems. I don't want her taking them, and I just want to tell you right up front, I do not want to hear anything about the fact that I do smoke. Um, I smoke outside, I smoke away from her. I do not ever do it around her. So I do not want to hear about that.
therapist: Well, I-I need to tell you that the-the medicine that she's taking, the chronic inhaler, which is really essential to controlling her asthma does-- is not a steroid like you're thinking. It's-it's much safer, it's very safe, she-- and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control, and I also want to tell you that, uh, your smoking does affect her asthma, even if- even if it's outside, it gets on her clothes, and to be honest, I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway. But, uh, if you want to keep her out of the emergency room, she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day, and you need to watch your smoking.
client: Okay, I-I am not going to allow her to take any kind of steroid. I am not going to allow that to happen. She's my daughter. She's my responsibility, and I'm not going to allow that to happen, and I absolutely make sure that the smoking does not affect her.
therapist: Okay, I, you know, I-I don't want to argue with you about this. I-I know that if you-you know, and if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room, uh, I-I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying. She needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her- to get her asthma under control, and the smoke on your clothes and the smoking flares her asthma up. So she really needs to use that chronic inhaler, and you really need to think about quitting smoking.
client: Fine. I'm in a really big hurry, and I need to get those prescriptions filled as soon as possible, please.
therapist: Okay, well, I-I hope you really listen to what I'm telling you about her using that chronic inhaler, and I hope you consider quitting smoking.
client: Fine. I just need to get my prescriptions.
therapist: Okay."
low,102,"therapist: Hi, Liz. Well, thanks for meeting with me today.
client: Sure.
therapist: So what's something that you'd like to change or, um, work towards?
client: Well, [sighs] I've been thinking about working out lately. I really want to start working out again. It's-it's been in my mind, I know I need to do it. It's just getting the motivation to do it.
therapist: And you've been talking about that a lot lately. So I really-
client: Mm-hmm.
therapist: -feel like this is something that you need to do soon because, um, a lot of times, you're just a lot of talk. And then, there's no action. And if you really wanna see results, I think it's something that needs to be done. And, you know, stop being lazy about it and just do it.
client: Well, I don't know if I'm really being lazy about it. I think it's just that I have a busy schedule.
therapist: Yeah.
client: I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might be lacking a little bit of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying to fit it in.
therapist: And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me. So I feel like you had shared with me before that you do have a gym membership. So I think that's something that you just need to fit in your schedule. So for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about three to four times a week and really fit in that hour workout, um, on a daily basis.
client: But I think that part of the problem is that I-I don't have three to four times- three to four times a week to do it, or an hour even. I mean, hour is a long time because if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there-
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: -time there, time back. I mean, it's not just an hour, it's like two hours, realistically.
therapist: And it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in. And if it's gonna take you two hours, then it's gonna take you two hours. And, again, if you want the results that you want, you need to start, and you need to start now.
client: Well, oh, um, okay.
therapist: All right. Well, um, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I'm hoping that you're gonna be able to tell me that you went to the gym.
client: Okay.
therapist: Thanks."
low,106,"therapist: Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so.
client: Yeah.
therapist: That's really a big problem.
client: Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. He gets really upset.
therapist: Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?
client: Yeah, I-- Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke around him.
therapist: Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so, what can you tell me about that?
client: I-I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car. Um, when he's home, I go outside to smoke. I just-- I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be around it so I try really hard.
therapist: I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also, things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?
client: No, but I don't smoke. I'm-- I-I-I've thought about quitting, but it's just- It's really hard so I just don't know how to do it.
therapist: Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-
client: I know, I know. I've heard-- People have told me before, I've heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's-it's so hard.
therapist: Well, there's all kinds of things you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call.
client: I just don't have time for any of that.
therapist: There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit, this is really important.
client: I understand that. I know it is. I mean, everybody has problems, right? It's just really-- It's really, really hard.
therapist: Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?
client: I don't know.
therapist: I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.
client: I'll-I'll-I'll go look at all those things and-and I'll find-- I guess I'll-I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my doctor about it.
therapist: Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger.
client: Okay, whatever. Okay.
therapist: Okay."
low,123,"therapist: Okay, I finished the exam. I have some good news and I have some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news.
client: That's great.
therapist: However, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'm just wondering what's going on.
client: I don't smoke cigarettes.
therapist: Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it.
client: Well, the only thing-- I've never smoked cigarettes ever, um, but, um, when, um, when I go out with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges.
therapist: Mm-hmm.
client: And, um, you know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. And we got some of those mini cigars that are Swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that-that's got tobacco in it.
therapist: Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?
client: Really? Bad? But they're just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars.
therapist: Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important.
client: Well, I only use them just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do it when we go out.
therapist: Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?
client: Well, I didn't really know I'd started.
therapist: What do you mean?
client: I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.
therapist: So you're gonna quit then?
client: Uh, maybe.
therapist: What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.
client: Well, it's something that I'll have to think about.
therapist: What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in.
client: Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back.
therapist: Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.
client: Well, I don't believe that they are cigars. And what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right, and it's something that I choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that. And I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real.
therapist: You're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually, it can cause problems with your teeth too. I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die.
client: Well, it's something that I'll think about.
therapist: Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change."
low,126,"therapist: Hello, Kaylie. It looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today.
client: Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.
therapist: Okay. It looks like cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?
client: No, not really.
therapist: Well, you just take it once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?
client: No.
therapist: Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, just call your doctor.
client: Okay. Um, why am I taking this medication?
therapist: It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh yeah, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?
client: No, I guess not.
therapist: All right. Great. Have a good day.
therapist: Hello, Kaylie. I see you're here to pick up a prescription today.
client: Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.
therapist: Oh, it looks like he called in cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take this medication?
client: No, not really.
therapist: Okay. Well, you take this one once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?
client: No.
therapist: All right. Well, some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, you should call your doctor.
client: Okay. Um, so why am I taking this medication?
therapist: It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one every day. Do you have any questions for me?
client: I guess not.
therapist: All right. Great. Well, have a good afternoon.
therapist: Hello, Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today. I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions.
client: Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.
therapist: Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?
client: Well, he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this.
therapist: He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?
client: He didn't really tell me. He just phoned it in.
therapist: Okay. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you normally take your medications?
client: Well, I take all of my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.
therapist: Okay. That's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?
client: I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my bed.
therapist: All right. Do you have any children in your home?
client: No.
therapist: Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?
client: He didn't mention anything about that.
therapist: All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.
therapist: Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?
client: Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away.
therapist: Great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?
client: Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.
therapist: Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every- at the same time every month. And if you have any other questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day.
therapist: Hello, Kaylie. I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new medication to pick up today. Called in by Dr. Ferris for cholesterol statin 20. Do you have a minute to talk about it? I want to make sure that you know how best to take this medicine and to answer any questions that you might have.
client: Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.
therapist: All right. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?
client: He told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol so that I should start taking this medication.
therapist: All right, and he's right. This medication will help lower your cholesterol, and it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did the doctor tell you to take this medicine?
client: He didn't tell me, he just phoned it in.
therapist: All right. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you usually take your medications?
client: I take all my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.
therapist: That's perfect. This medication can be taken any time of the day, but it does work best if taken in the evening, and it's important to take it every day.
therapist: Where do you store your medications?
client: I store them all in the nightstand by my bed.
therapist: Do you have children in your house?
client: No. I don't have any kids.
therapist: All right. So that sounds like a perfect place for you to store those. Medications are best when they're stored away from light, heat and moisture.
therapist: What did your doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?
client: He didn't mention anything about that.
therapist: All right. Well, this medication is usually well tolerated, which means that it doesn't have very many side effects, but you might experience some muscle aches or pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, this medication can interact with over-the-counter medicines or even other medications. So before you start something new, you should check with either Dr. Ferris or myself. And lastly, this medication can interact with grapefruit juice. So while you're taking this medicine, I would avoid grapefruit juice.
therapist: Just so we know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you are going to take this medicine?
client: Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet of the cholesterol statin, uh, in the evening with all my other medications. And I guess I'll switch to orange juice. And if I notice any bad muscle pains, then I'll be sure to call Dr. Ferris right away.
therapist: That's great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What questions do you still have for me?
client: I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.
therapist: All right, good. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on autofill for you so it'll be ready at the same time every month for you. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day."
